Once you've successfully configured a PDF on one of your Gravity Forms you'll be able to view and download the PDFs from the [Gravity Forms entries page](https://docs.gravityforms.com/entries/) in your admin area. **If the list is empty you'll need to fill out and submit your form first**.

## Entry List 

![The Gravity Forms Entry List page with View PDF link](https://resources.gravitypdf.com/uploads/2015/11/entry-list-v5.png) When viewing the entries list a "View PDF/View PDFs" or "Download PDF/Download PDFs" link will be added to each entry's quick toolbar. These links get displayed when you hover over an entry. The text View PDF or Download PDF will show up based on your global [*Entry View*](user-global-settings.md#view) setting.

## Entry Details 

![The Gravity Forms Entry Details page with PDF links](https://resources.gravitypdf.com/uploads/2015/11/entry-details-v5.png) You can also view and download your PDFs from the [entry details page](https://docs.gravityforms.com/entry-detail/) in your admin area. A new *PDF* heading will be included under the right *Entry* sidebar widget and allow you to view and download any configured PDFs.

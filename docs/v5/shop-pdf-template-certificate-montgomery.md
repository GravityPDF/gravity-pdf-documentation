The *Montgomery* premium PDF template is a modern take on the formal business certificate. It can be [purchased from our PDF Template Shop](https://gravitypdf.com/shop/). This guide will walk you through installing and configuring *Montgomery* to its full potential.

## Installation 

[Please follow our installation guide](shop-installing-upgrading-premium-templates.md), which provides instructions for setting up and configuring your premium template.

## Limitations 

*Montgomery* can be used with all Gravity Forms. You'll have access to your form data for use in the certificate through Gravity Forms Merge Tags. For more information, see the [Gravity Forms Merge Tags documentation](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/user-guides/merge-tags-getting-started/).

## Configuring 

All PDF templates have common settings that can be configured, such as font, security and PDF attachments, and we recommend [reviewing the PDF setup guide](user-setup-pdf.md) to get a better understanding of all the available settings. All template-specific configuration is done from the *Template* tab, and below you'll find detailed information about each option available in *Formal Letter*, what it does and how it alters the generated PDF.

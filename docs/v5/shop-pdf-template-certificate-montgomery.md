The *Montgomery* premium PDF template is a modern take on the formal business certificate and can be [purchased from our PDF Template Shop](https://gravitypdf.com/shop/). This guide will walk you through installing and configuring *Montgomery* to its full potential.

## Installation 

[Please follow our installation guide](shop-installing-upgrading-premium-templates.md), which provides instructions for setting up and configuring your premium template.

## Limitations 

*Montgomery* can be used with all Gravity Forms. You'll have access to your form data for use in the certificate through Gravity Forms Merge Tags. For more information, see the [Gravity Forms Merge Tags documentation](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/user-guides/merge-tags-getting-started/).

## Configuring 

All PDF templates have common settings that can be configured, such as font, security and PDF attachments, and we recommend [reviewing the PDF setup guide](user-setup-pdf.md) to get a better understanding on all the available settings. All template-specific configuration is done from the *Template* tab and below you'll find detailed information about each option available in *Formal Letter*, what it does and how it alters the generated PDF.

### Organization Details

#### Logo (1) 
* Upload your company / business logo for inclusion in the letter.
* An image 500px wide will be a suitable resolution in most cases. To ensure your PDF generates quickly and the PDF file size stays small, we recommend using an image under 1MB.

#### Business Name (2) 
* The name of the company that appears below the logo. This moves slightly upwards and its font sizes increases slightly when there is no logo set.
* If you leave this setting blank, it won't be included in the PDF.

### Certificate Configuration

#### Awardee Name (6)

## Recommended Font 

*Open Sans L Li B Bi* is a free font family by Ascender Fonts that is easy to read and works well with *Montgomery* at 14pt. Set the PDF font in the [Appearance tab](user-setup-pdf.md#appearance-tab).

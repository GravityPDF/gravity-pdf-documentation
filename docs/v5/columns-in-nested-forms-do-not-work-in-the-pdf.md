Due to limitations of the PDF software, columns are not currently supported in the <a href="https://gravitywiz.com/documentation/gravity-forms-nested-forms/?ref=78" rel="sponsored">Gravity Wiz Nested Forms</a> field when it is displayed in a Core or Universal PDF template.Â If you'd like full control over the layout of the Nested Forms data, you will [need to create a custom PDF template](developer-start-customising.md).

By default, Gravity PDF will display all files uploaded using the [File Upload field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/file-upload/) as a bullet point list with links to those files.

Out of the box, it isn't possible to display uploaded images in the Core (free) or <a href="https://gravitypdf.com/template-shop/#universal">Universal (paid)</a> PDFs, and we've done this for technical reasons: loading more than 10MB of images (less on some shared hosting) can cause significant PDF generation times, or PHP fatal errors.

To work around this limitation and display / show / embed uploaded images in Gravity PDF, we recommend the [Image Hopper add-on](https://imagehopper.tech/). This plugin can be configured to automatically downsize and rotate images on the client-side, which helps to prevent timeout issues during the PDF generation.

Once installed, add a new Image Hopper field to your Gravity Form. Just make sure to set the *Downscale Images* width and height setting to no more than 1000x1000px to prevent the aforementioned image size issue. Gravity PDF will now automatically display / show the uploaded images in the Core / Universal PDFs.

Previously we recommend using the Slim Image Cropper for Gravity Forms plugin, but it was discontinued by its developer.

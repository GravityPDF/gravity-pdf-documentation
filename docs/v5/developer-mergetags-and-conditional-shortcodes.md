## Introduction 

Gravity Forms has a [powerful macro they call *Merge Tags*](https://www.gravityhelp.com/documentation/article/merge-tags/) which allows you to display form content, user meta data, post data and other information like the entry submission date. There's also [conditional shortcodes](https://www.gravityhelp.com/documentation/article/shortcodes/#conditional-shortcode) which you can use to allow simple *IF* statements. Both merge tags and conditional shortcodes are supported in PDF templates and together they make a powerful combination.

## Template Tutorial – Part 2 

![The Hello World Gravity Forms form](https://resources.gravitypdf.com/uploads/2015/11/hello-world-form.png)

In [Template Tutorial – Part 1](developer-first-custom-pdf.md#template-tutorial) we showed you the very minimum needed to create a PDF template. In part 2 we're going to utilise merge tags and conditional shortcodes in a template. Before you begin you will need to [download the Gravity Forms form](https://resources.gravitypdf.com/uploads/2015/11/hello-world-gravity-form.json) (right click and 'save link as') we'll be working with and [import it into your website](https://www.gravityhelp.com/documentation/article/importing-a-form-into-gravity-forms/). Once done, submit a new entry for the newly-imported *Hello World* form.

### Merge Tags 

![Mergetags in a Gravity Forms Notification](https://resources.gravitypdf.com/uploads/2015/11/merge-tags.png)

Gravity Forms *field-type* merge tags use the format `{[Field Name]:[field_id]}`. Keep in mind, the *Field Name* isn't required, so `{:2}` is a valid merge tag, and advanced fields can have a slightly different format – the first name in a Name field is displayed as `{:20.3}`.

When you first start using merge tags, the simplest way to write them is by editing one of your [form's notifications](https://www.gravityhelp.com/documentation/article/configuring-notifications-in-gravity-forms/) and then using the merge tag selector to the right of the *Message* field. Just copy and paste the merge tag to your PDF template.

Once you're comfortable with how certain fields are formatted it becomes easy to write your own: `{Email:5}`, `{:5}`, `{First Name:4.3}` or `{:4.3}`.

In our `hello-world.php` template we're going to add a new line below the `<h1>` tag and include our form's merge tags:

```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>

<p>You're from {Where do you live?:3}, {Name (First):1.3}? How cool is that!</p>
```    

After uploading the template, when you view the *Hello World* PDF for the entry you created earlier it will include the Gravity Forms data. All Gravity Form fields can be displayed in the PDF this way.

### Conditional Shortcodes 

Conditional Shortcodes allow you to output different content in the PDF based on a user's response. The structure of the shortcode is relatively simple, with four required attributes including: `action`, `merge_tag`, `condition` and `value`. [See the Gravity Forms documentation for full details on its usage](https://docs.gravityforms.com/conditional-shortcode/).

:::info
When your `value` contains any of the following characters `<`, `>`, `"`, `'` or `&` you'll need to use the WordPress function `esc_html()` to get the desired result.
Example: `condition="is" value="<?php echo esc_html( 'Honey & Spice' ); ?>"]`
:::

In our `hello-world.php` template we're going to add conditional shortcodes that outputs a small fact about where the user lives. If a user selects `Earth` only the Earth fact will be displayed. Below the line we just added we'll include the following:

```html
<p>You're from {Where do you live?:3}, {Name (First):1.3}? How cool is that!</p>

[gravityforms action="conditional" merge_tag="{Where do you live?:3}" condition="is" value="Earth"]
    <p>The birth-rate on Earth has dropped almost 25% in the past 50 years due to colonisation of the solar system.</p>
[/gravityforms]

[gravityforms action="conditional" merge_tag="{Where do you live?:3}" condition="is" value="Moon"]
    <p>The lunar colony was first established in 2115 with a population of 200. Now it supports over 900,000 people.</p>
[/gravityforms]

[gravityforms action="conditional" merge_tag="{Where do you live?:3}" condition="is" value="Mars"]
    <p>Mars was the second body to be colonised in the solar system in 2135, 20 years after the moon.</p>
[/gravityforms]

[gravityforms action="conditional" merge_tag="{Where do you live?:3}" condition="is" value="Titan"]
    <p>Titan's colony is only recently established. You're one of only 500 people currently living there!</p>
[/gravityforms]
```

When you view the *Hello World* PDF now it will conditionally display one of the four facts. Then [edit the *Hello World* entry](https://www.gravityhelp.com/documentation/article/entry-detail/) and changing the `Where do you live?` field value. When you view the PDF again a different fact will be displayed.

If Gravity PDF prompts you to manually initialise you’ll need to follow the link in the prompt or navigate to Gravity Forms -&gt; Settings -&gt; PDF.

<h3>  What does initialisation do?  </h3>

When initialising, Gravity PDF creates a directory specifically for your PDF template and configuration files. If you are running a multisite installation, and are logged in as a super administrator, it does this for all sites in your network.

<h3>  System Status  </h3>

There are <a href="/v3/installation-requirements/">a number of requirements that need to be met</a> before Gravity PDF will attempt to run. If there is any requirements that are not met the system status will indicate an error and suggest a solution.

<h3>  Initialising  </h3>

Initialising is as simple as selecting the <em>Initialise Plugin</em> button. As the plugin is creating directories and moving files some users will be prompted to enter their FTP or SFTP details to complete the process.

<h3>  Initialisation Completed  </h3>

Once you’ve completed the initialisation process you will be able to view the default PDF template in all your form entries.

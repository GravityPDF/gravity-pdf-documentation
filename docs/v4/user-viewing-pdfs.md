Once you've successfully configured a PDF on one of your Gravity Forms you'll be able to view and download the PDFs from the [Gravity Forms entries page](https://www.gravityhelp.com/documentation/article/entries/) in your admin area. **If the list is empty you'll need to fill out and submit your form first**.

### Entry List

When viewing the entries list a "View PDF/View PDFs" or "Download PDF/Download PDFs" link will be added to each entry's quick toolbar – which gets displayed when you hover over the first cell of any entry. The View/Download text you'll see depends on your global [*Entry View*](user-global-settings.md#view) setting.

### Entry Details

You can also view and download your PDFs from the [entry details page](https://www.gravityhelp.com/documentation/article/entry-detail/) in your admin area. A new *PDF* heading will be included under the right *Entry* sidebar widget and allow you to view and download any configured PDFs.

![The PDF admin menu items that should be hidden](https://resources.gravitypdf.com/uploads/2016/06/pdf-admin-menu-links-in-dashboard.png)

If you are using the [Admin Menu Editor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/admin-menu-editor/) to show/hide the admin main menu you may find two new menu items are included under Dashboard:

1. Welcome to Gravity PDF
1. What's new in Gravity PDF?

By default these two menu items are hidden, but they may have inadvertently been set to "show" when using the plugin. The simple fix is to hide those menus again.

Gravity PDF is a **free WordPress plugin** built for the popular premium form builder software, [Gravity Forms](https://rocketgenius.pxf.io/c/1211356/445235/7938). It allows you to generate PDF documents that contain user-data captured with Gravity Forms. 

The look and feel of the PDF is controlled through templates. The software comes with **four free designs**, but you can also [purchase additional templates from our template shop](https://gravitypdf.com/template-shop/), [build your own using HTML and CSS](developer-start-customising.md) or have our team [custom-build one for you](https://gravitypdf.com/integration-services/) â€“ we can even auto-complete existing PDF documents like government forms.

### Installation 

Assuming you [meet the software minimum requirements](user-installation.md), the installation is a breeze. Head to `Plugins -> Add New` in your WordPress admin area, search *Gravity PDF*, click **Install Now** and activate. It's that simple!

[View additional information about the software requirements and other installation procedures](user-installation.md). 

### General Settings 

After activating, head to `Form -> Settings -> PDF` and check over the plugin's default settings. The software uses sane defaults but you may want to tweak the PDF paper size, PDF template and font family, size and colour. You should also check the *System Status* to make sure there are no warnings that may need your attention.

### Creating a PDF 

Next, it's time to setup a PDF for your Gravity Form. Head to `Forms -> Forms` and select the Gravity Form you want integrated. From the form editor page, hover over the `Form Settings` menu item and select `PDF` from the sub-navigation. Finally, click the `Add New` button to create a PDF.

While there are a lot of options available to you, only the `Name` and `Filename` settings are required. Go ahead and fill those in. If you want the **PDF automatically emailed** when your form is submitted select the notifications you want it attached it in the [Notifications setting](user-setup-pdf.md#notifications). Finally, click *Add PDF* to complete the setup.

Now you've setup the PDF you can view and download it from the Gravity Form Entries page in your admin area (just make sure you've submitted an entry already). And if you configured it, when you submit the form the generated PDF will be attached with the email notification.

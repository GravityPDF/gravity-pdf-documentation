You've purchased a [premium extension/plugin through our online store](https://gravitypdf.com/extension-shop/). The next step is to install it on your website.

:::info 
Before you begin, please ensure you have the [Gravity Forms](https://rocketgenius.pxf.io/c/1211356/445235/7938) and [Gravity PDF](../users/five-minute-install.md) plugins both active on your WordPress website. Done? Good! Now let's get you up and running with your new premium plugin.
:::

Once you've completed your purchase you'll receive an email containing a link to your plugin zip file – the email also contains your product key which will give you access to support and one-click updates: keep it safe!

## Install Steps 

:::note
If your browser auto-extracts zip files when downloaded, you'll need to temporarily disable this functionality to prevent issues during installation. [See how to disable this in Safari](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/963).
:::

1.  Open the Shop Receipt email you received and locate the *Your Purchases* section. Click the link to download the plugin zip package.

4.  Click the `Install Now` button and wait. Depending on your internet speed, it could take some time to upload.

5.  Once installed, select the `Activate Plugin` link.

6.  To enable one-click updates, locate the newly-installed plugin in the list and click the "Register your copy of *PLUGIN\_NAME*" link.

7.  Enter then save your license key (found in your Receipt email). If the registration is successful, a tick will be displayed next to the license.

## One Click Updates 

As long as you've registered your license key (as outlined in the [Install Steps](#install-steps)) and it's still valid (all keys are valid for 12 months after purchase), your extension will periodically check GravityPDF.com for a new version. If there is a new version, it'll be shown on the [Dashboard Updates Screen](https://wordpress.org/support/article/dashboard-updates-screen/) or the Plugins page, and you can one-click update the software.

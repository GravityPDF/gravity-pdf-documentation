description: "For multisite installations we create a subdirectory inside the PDF_EXTENDED_TEMPLATES folder using each multisite's ID."
---

## Description 

By default, the [PDF working directory](first-custom-pdf.md#working-directory) is found in your `/wp-content/uploads/PDF_EXTENDED_TEMPLATES` folder. For multisite installations we also create a subdirectory inside the `PDF_EXTENDED_TEMPLATES` folder using each multisite's ID. This filter allows you to change that location (but you'll normally want to use the [`gfpdf_template_location` filter](gfpdf_template_location.md) instead). 

The multisite working directory **MUST be in a publicly accessible folder** (accessed via a URL) and **MUST be used in conjunction with the [`gfpdf_multisite_template_location_uri`](gfpdf_multisite_template_location_uri.md) filter**. Both the `gfpdf_multisite_template_location` and `gfpdf_multisite_template_location_uri` filters should point to the same directory â€“ one is the path and one is the URL.

*Note:* your web server needs write access to the folder you move the working directory to.

You can also use this filter by targeting the multisite ID directly: `gfpdf_multisite_template_location_$blog_id`. 

## Parameters 

### $directory | string
*  The path to the multisite [PDF working directory](first-custom-pdf.md#working-directory)

### $working_folder | string
*  The working directory folder name. By default this is `PDF_EXTENDED_TEMPLATES`.

### $upload_path | string
*  The path to your uploads directory (where the PDF working directory is stored by default).

### $blog_id | integer
*  The current ID of the multisite being processed

## Usage 

The following snippet shows you how you can move the multisite PDF working directory for site #3 to your `wp-content` directory (instead of its original location in your uploads folder):

```
add_filter( 'gfpdf_multisite_template_location', function( $directory, $working_folder, $upload_path, $blog_id ) {
	if ( 3 == $blog_id ) {
		/* Make sure you include the forward slash! */
		return WP_CONTENT_DIR . '/' . $working_folder . '/';
	}

	return $directory;
}, 10, 4 );

/**
 * You must use the `gfpdf_multisite_template_location` filter in conjunction with the `gfpdf_multisite_template_location_uri` filter
 * Both filters should point to the same directory (one is the path and one is the URL)
 */
add_filter( 'gfpdf_template_location_uri', function( $url, $working_folder, $upload_url, $blog_id ) {
	if ( 3 == $blog_id ) {
		/* Make sure you include the forward slash! */
		return WP_CONTENT_URL . '/' . $working_folder . '/';
	}

	return $url;
}, 10, 4 );
```

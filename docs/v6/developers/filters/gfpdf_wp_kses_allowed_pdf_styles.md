## Description

To improve security, [in Gravity PDF 6.4 we introduced a number of changes to how templates get rendered](https://gravitypdf.com/news/gravity-pdf-6-4-a-focus-on-security/). To that end, all HTML mark-up generated by Gravity PDF in Core and Universal templates is now sanitizing by a customized `wp_kses()` function. 

Use this filter to modify the allowed inline CSS styles in any Core/Universal template.  

## Version

This filter was introduced in Gravity PDF 6.4.2

## Parameters

### $tags | array
* An array of allowed CSS property names that can be used inline in the `style` attribute

## Usage

Adds support for the [custom mPDF CSS property](https://mpdf.github.io/css-stylesheets/supported-css.html) `margin-collapse`:

```
add_filter( 'gfpdf_wp_kses_allowed_pdf_styles', function( $styles ) {
    $styles[] = 'margin-collapse';
	
	return $styles;
} );
```

## Source Code

This filter is located in the `Kses.php` files in the `/src/Statics/` directory.

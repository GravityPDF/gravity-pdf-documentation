## Usage

```
add_action( 'gfpdf_post_help_settings_page', function() {
	/* We set the action priority to 3 so this content will be included before the Uninstaller */
	?>
		<h3><?php _e( 'Custom Section', 'prefix-text-domain' ); ?></h3>
		<p><?php _e( 'This is the message for this new section. You should include any additional functionality here...', 'prefix-text-domain' ); ?></p>
	<?php
}, 3 );
```

## Source Code 

This action is located in `/src/view/html/Settings/help.php`.

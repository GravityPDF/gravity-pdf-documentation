## Installing a Premium Template 

You've purchased a [premium PDF template through our online store](https://gravitypdf.com/template-shop/). The next step is to install it on your website.

:::info
Before you begin please ensure you have the [Gravity Forms](https://rocketgenius.pxf.io/c/1211356/445235/7938) and [Gravity PDF](../users/five-minute-install.md) plugins both active on your WordPress website. Done? Good! Now let's get you up and running with your new premium template.
:::

Once you've completed your purchase you'll receive an email containing a link to your PDF template zip file – the email also contains your product key which will give you access to support: keep it safe! Your template can easily be installed [through the PDF Template Manager](../users/pdf-template-manager.md) which is accessed two ways: through the [PDF global settings](../users/global-settings.md#default-template); or when you [configure a new PDF on your form](../users/setup-pdf.md#template). We're going to walk you through the later option as it's quicker.

### Install Steps 

:::note
If your browser auto-extracts zip files when downloaded **you'll need to temporarily disable this functionality to prevent issues during installation**. [See how to disable this in Safari](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/963).
:::

1.  Open the Shop Receipt email you received and locate the *Your Purchases* section. Click the link to download the template zip package.
    ![Your purchase receipt contains the downloads to your premium template](https://resources.gravitypdf.com/uploads/2017/03/purchase-email.png)

2.  Login to your WordPress admin area and [locate the form PDF settings by following these instructions](../users/setup-pdf.md#locating-pdf-settings).

3.  You should now be on the *Add PDF Settings Page* and will see an option under the *General* tab called *Template* – the option includes a dropdown of all your installed templates and a button labelled *Advanced*. Click the button to open the *PDF Template Manager*.
    ![Access the Template Manager through the Advanced button](https://resources.gravitypdf.com/uploads/2017/03/access.png)

4.  A new window will open showing a graphical view of all your installed PDF templates. Scroll to the bottom of the window until you see a box with the text *Add New Template*. Either drag and drop the zip file you downloaded during step 1 into this box, or click the box and locate the zip file in the *File Upload* window that appears.

5.  If everything goes well you'll see your newly-purchased PDF in the Manager. Next, click the *Select* button to use the template. The Manager will close automatically when you do this.

6.  Fill in the required Name and Filename fields and click the *Add PDF* button at the bottom of the page.

7.  Navigate to the Template tab and customise your PDF. Don't forget to click the *Update PDF* button when you're done! 
![The Template tab is where you customise your PDF](https://resources.gravitypdf.com/uploads/edd/2017/03/settings-page-1-1.png)

8.  Finally, [view your PDF from the entries list page](../users/viewing-pdfs.md#entry-list) by hovering over an entry and selecting the *View PDF* link. If the list is empty you'll need to submit an entry first.

## Upgrading Premium Template 

:::caution
You'll lose any changes you make to the PDF template file(s) during an update. Customisations you make through your WP Admin area are not effected.
:::

When a new version becomes available, download the updated PDF Template [from your Account](https://gravitypdf.com/account/#downloads) and [follow the same installation procedure](#install-steps) you originally took. Simple!

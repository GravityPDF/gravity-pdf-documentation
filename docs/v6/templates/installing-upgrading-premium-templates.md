## Installing a Premium Template 

You've purchased a [premium PDF template through our online store](https://gravitypdf.com/store/#templates). The next step is to install it on your website.

:::info
Before you begin, please ensure you have the <a href="https://rocketgenius.pxf.io/c/1211356/445235/7938" rel="sponsored">Gravity Forms</a> and [Gravity PDF](../users/five-minute-install.md) plugins both active on your WordPress website. Done? Good! Now let's get you up and running with your new premium template.
:::

Once you've completed your purchase you'll receive an email containing a link to your PDF template zip file – the email also contains your product key which will give you access to support: keep it safe! 

Your template can easily be installed [through the PDF Template Manager](../users/pdf-template-manager.md) which is accessed two ways: 

1. View the [PDF global settings](../users/global-settings.md#default-template)
1. When you [configure a new PDF on your form](../users/setup-pdf.md#template). 
   
We're going to walk you through the latter option as it's faster.

### Install Steps 

:::note
If your browser auto-extracts zip files when downloaded, **you'll need to temporarily disable this functionality to prevent issues during installation**. [See how to disable this in Safari](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/963).
:::

1.  Open the Shop Receipt email you received and locate the *Your Purchases* section. Click the link to download the template zip package.
    ![Your purchase receipt contains the downloads to your premium template](https://resources.gravitypdf.com/uploads/2017/03/purchase-email.png)

2.  Login to your WordPress admin area and [locate the form PDF settings by following these instructions](../users/setup-pdf.md#locating-pdf-settings).

3.  You should now be on the *Add PDF Settings Page* and will see an option under the *General* section called *Template* – the option includes a dropdown of all your installed templates, and a button labelled *Manage*. Select the button to open the *PDF Template Manager*.
    ![Access the Template Manager through the Manage button](https://resources.gravitypdf.com/uploads/2022/03/v6.2-Manage-PDF-Templates.jpg)

4.  A new window will open, showing a graphical view of all your installed PDF templates. Scroll to the bottom of the window until you see a box with the text *Add New Template*. Either drag and drop the zip file you downloaded during step 1 into this box, or click the box and locate the zip file in the *File Upload* window that appears.

5.  If everything goes well, you'll see your newly-purchased PDF in the Manager. Next, click the *Select* button to use the template. The Manager will close automatically when you do this.

6.  Fill in the required Name and Filename fields, then go through the other available settings and adjust as needed..

7.  Click the *Add PDF* button when you're done! 
![The Template section is where you customise your PDF](https://resources.gravitypdf.com/uploads/2022/03/v6.2-PDF-Template-Settings.png)

8.  Finally, [view your PDF from the entries list page](../users/viewing-pdfs.md#entry-list) by hovering over an entry and selecting the *View PDF* link. If the list is empty, you'll need to submit an entry first.

## Upgrading Premium Template 

:::caution
You'll lose any changes you make to the PDF template file(s) during an update. Customisations you make through your WP Admin area are not affected.
:::

When a new version becomes available, download the updated PDF Template [from your Account](https://gravitypdf.com/account/#downloads) and [follow the same installation procedure](#install-steps) you originally took.

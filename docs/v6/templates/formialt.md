*Formialt* is a premium PDF template with rounded corners, robust colour control, and compact design. You can purchase it from our [PDF Template Shop](https://gravitypdf.com/shop/formialt/). This guide will walk you through installing and configuring *Formialt* to its full potential.

## Installation 

[Please follow our installation guide](installing-upgrading-premium-templates.md), which provides instructions for setting up and configuring your premium template.

## Limitations 

As a *Universal* PDF template, *Formialt* can be used with all Gravity Forms and will correctly display any official Gravity Forms fields. *Formialt* does not support [CSS Ready Class columns](../users/css-ready-classes.md).

## Configuring 

All PDF templates have common settings that can be configured, such as font, security and PDF attachments, and we recommend [reviewing the PDF setup guide](../users/setup-pdf.md) to get a better understanding on all the available settings. All template-specific configuration is done from the *Template* tab and below you'll find detailed information about each option available in *Formialt*, what it does and how it alters the generated PDF.

### Main Heading 
* The main heading is left-aligned and included on first page of your PDF, before any of your Gravity Forms fields. Merge tags are supported.
* The Main Heading background will use the [Heading Background Color](#heading-background-color), while the font color will be set to black or white, depending on the best contrast.
* Leave the field blank to disable.
* This option replaces the "Show Form Title" setting. To replicate, use the `{form_title}` merge tag.

### Heading Background Color 
* The Heading Background Color is used for the Main Heading and Section Break Title.
* The default colour is Mountbatten Pink (hex `#9e7b9b`).

### Field Background Color 
* The Field Background Color is used for all Gravity Forms fields except the HTML and Page fields, as well as the Section Break Description (which don't have a background). 
* The field font color will be set to black or white, depending on the best contrast.
* The default colour is Dove Gray (hex `#666666`).

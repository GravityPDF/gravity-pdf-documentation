Due to limitations of the PDF software, columns are not currently supported in the [Gravity Wiz Nested Forms](https://gravitywiz.com/documentation/gravity-forms-nested-forms/?ref=78) field when it is displayed in a Core or Universal PDF template.Â If you'd like full control over the layout of the Nested Forms data, you will [need to create a custom PDF template](start-customising.md).

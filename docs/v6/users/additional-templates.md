While Gravity PDF ships with **four free customisable PDF templates**, they may not suit your specific purpose or use-case. That's why we've also built a [premium template shop](https://gravitypdf.com/template-shop/) to give you more layout and design choices. 

If you can't find anything you like in the shop, we also offer [custom template creation and installation services](https://gravitypdf.com/integration-services/) â€“ these are unique PDF templates crafted and installed to your specifications by our skilled team of developers. Our team can also **auto-fill existing PDF documents**, which is perfect when you need to integrate legal or government forms (this feature isn't available in our free or DIY offering). 

Finally, for those DIY aficionados with HTML/CSS/PHP knowledge we've got [extensive documentation](../developers/start-customising.md) on how you can build, configure and install your own templates. 

## PDF Template Shop 

[The PDF Template Shop](https://gravitypdf.com/shop/) is your first port of call for high quality PDF templates at an affordable price. All PDFs will come with 12-months warranty, support and updates.

## Integration Services 

This is our premium service for users who [need a bespoke solution tailored specifically for specifically for their business](https://gravitypdf.com/integration-services/). We can generate business cards, flyers, coupons, government, legal documents and much, much more. It's a one-time fee and there are no limits on the number of PDFs you can generate, or any monthly fees!

## DIY Templates 

Not to leave developers in the dark, [we have extensive documentation taking you step-by-step through the process of creating custom PDF templates](../developers/start-customising.md). We also go through advanced features like floats and absolute positioning, watermarks and page layouts.

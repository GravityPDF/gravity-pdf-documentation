[The GravityView plugin](https://gravityview.co/?ref=186) is the best way to display Gravity Forms entries publicly on your website. Basic GravityView support is built right into Gravity PDF.

## Add PDF Download Link to View 

You can easily add PDF Download links to your View. To do this you'll need to use [GravityView's Custom Content Field](http://docs.gravityview.co/article/111-using-the-custom-content-field). Go edit your View in the admin area, click the `+ Add Field` button in the *Multiple Entries* or *Single Entry* tab, and click *Custom Content*. Next, go to your form's [Manage PDF page](managing-pdfs.md), copy the `[gravitypdf]` shortcode in the list and paste it into the View's Custom Content Field. Save the View and go check if it's working.

Because of [Gravity PDF's security](pdf-security.md), by default access to the PDFs is restricted to the entry owner or users with a capability found in the [User Restriction setting](global-settings.md#user-restriction). That means that you'd need to:

1.  Using [GravityView's Advanced Filter extension](https://gravityview.co/extensions/advanced-filter/?ref=186) to [show the entries from the current logged in user](https://docs.gravityview.co/article/203-how-to-show-only-results-submitted-by-the-current-user).

2.  Using a Membership plugin that allows you to show/hide content based on user roles ([Paid Memberships Pro](https://wordpress.org/plugins/paid-memberships-pro/) comes to mind). You can display the GravityView to a user with a Role that includes one of the capabilities found in Gravity PDF's [User Restriction setting](global-settings.md#user-restriction) â€“ by default this is only the Administrator role. Not sure what Roles and Capabilities are? [Here's a great article from WPShout discussing the finer points](https://wpshout.com/working-with-wordpress-user-roles-and-capabilities/).

## Public Access 

If you'd like anyone with access to your View to securely download the PDF(s), you can [take advantage of signed PDF URLs](shortcodes.md#signed-attribute) introduced in Gravity PDF 5.1. Just amend the [gravitypdf] shortcode added to the Custom Content Field and include the `signed="1"` attribute:

`[gravitypdf name="Default Template" id="56ea5a3b2c684" text="Download PDF" signed="1"]`

<p><a href="https://www.gravitykit.com/features/?ref=186" rel="sponsored">The GravityView plugin</a> is one of the best way to display Gravity Forms entries publicly on your website. Basic GravityView support is built right into Gravity PDF, and advanced support is available <a href="https://gravitypdf.com/shop/pdf-for-gravityview-add-on/">using the <em>PDF for GravityView</em> extension</a>. The documentation on this page will only cover the basic support, and you should <a href="../extensions/pdf-for-gravityview-add-on/">refer to the <em>PDF for GravityView</em> documentation for the advanced feature-set</a>.</p>

[_PDF for GravityView_ is a premium Gravity PDF extension](https://gravitypdf.com/shop/pdf-for-gravityview-add-on/) which offers deep integration with the View Editor. This [turns GravityView into a powerful PDF builder](https://gravitypdf.com/news/turning-gravityview-into-a-powerful-pdf-builder-tool/), and makes it easy to generate PDFs of your Views. You'll save hours compared to [replicating your view in code using a custom template](../developers/first-custom-pdf.md).

## Add PDF Download Link to View

You can easily add PDF Download links to your View. To do this you'll need to use [GravityView's Custom Content Field](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/111-using-the-custom-content-field).

<ResponsiveEmbed src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/671780459?dnt=1" allowfullscreen />

Go edit your View in the admin area, click the `+ Add Field` button in the *Multiple Entries* or *Single Entry* tab, and click *Custom Content*. Next, go to your form's [Manage PDF page](managing-pdfs.md), copy the `[gravitypdf]` shortcode in the list and paste it into the View's Custom Content Field. Save the View and go check if it's working.

Because of [Gravity PDF's security](pdf-security.md), by default access to the PDFs is restricted to the entry owner or users with a capability found in the [User Restriction setting](global-settings.md#user-restriction). That means that you'd need to:

1.  Using <a href="https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/advanced-filter/?ref=186" rel="sponsored">GravityView's Advanced Filter extension</a> to [show the entries from the current logged in user](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/203-how-to-show-only-results-submitted-by-the-current-user).

2.  Using a Membership plugin that allows you to show/hide content based on user roles ([Paid Memberships Pro](https://wordpress.org/plugins/paid-memberships-pro/) comes to mind). You can display the GravityView to a user with a Role that includes one of the capabilities found in Gravity PDF's [User Restriction setting](global-settings.md#user-restriction) â€“ by default, this is only the Administrator role. Not sure what Roles and Capabilities are? [Here's a great article from WPShout discussing the finer points](https://wpshout.com/working-with-wordpress-user-roles-and-capabilities/).

## Public Access

If you'd like anyone with access to your View to securely download the PDF(s), you can [take advantage of signed PDF URLs](shortcodes-and-mergetags.md#signed-optional). Just amend the [gravitypdf] shortcode added to the Custom Content Field and include the `signed="1"` attribute:

`[gravitypdf name="Default Template" id="56ea5a3b2c684" text="Download PDF" signed="1"]`

## Multiple Forms Extensions

If you're using [GravityView's Multiple Forms extension](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/multiple-forms/?ref=186) and want to display a PDF from one of the _joined_ forms the process is slightly different.

1. Add a new Custom Content field to your View for the specific form the PDF is setup on.
![A screenshot of GravityView's Add Field buttons for multiple forms in the View](https://resources.gravitypdf.com/uploads/2022/08/gravityview-add-fields-from-specific-forms.png)

2. Copy the `[gravitypdf]` shortcode from the [Manage PDF page](managing-pdfs.md)and paste it into the View's Custom Content Field created in step 1
3. Manually add the `entry` attribute to the shortcode and set the value to `{entry_id}`

`[gravitypdf name="Default Template" id="56ea5a3b2c684" text="Download PDF" entry="{entry_id}"]`

These steps will ensure the joined form's entry ID is used to create the PDF link, and not the primary form's entry ID.

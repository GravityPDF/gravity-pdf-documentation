<a href="https://gravityflow.io/?ref=12" rel="sponsored">The Gravity Flow plugin</a> is a powerful workflow management system which includes basic Gravity PDF integration for its Approval, User Input and Notification workflow steps. For full details on setting up Workflows in Gravity Flow [please refer to their documentation](http://docs.gravityflow.io/).

## Approval Workflow

When setting up the Approval Workflow you'll be able to attach a PDF to the Assignee Email, Rejection Email and Approval Email notifications. To do this check the appropriate PDFs under the *Attach PDF(s)* setting. Be aware that [Gravity PDF Conditional Logic](setup-pdf.md#conditional-logic) **is not supported** and the PDF you setup will always be attached to the email.

## User Input Workflow

When setting up the User Input Workflow you can attach a PDF to the email notification. Like in the Approval Workflow, check the appropriate PDFs under the *Attach PDF(s)* setting. [Gravity PDF Conditional Logic](setup-pdf.md#conditional-logic) **is also not supported** in this Workflow.

## Notification Workflow

![Notification Workflow](https://resources.gravitypdf.com/uploads/2021/03/Gravity-Flow-Notification-Workflow.png)

As this Workflow actually sends the standard Gravity Forms Notification, Gravity PDF is fully supported â€“ including [Gravity PDF Conditional Logic](setup-pdf.md#conditional-logic). All you have to do is [configure Gravity PDF to attach PDF(s) to notifications](setup-pdf.md#notifications) and select the notification(s) you want to send in the Workflow.

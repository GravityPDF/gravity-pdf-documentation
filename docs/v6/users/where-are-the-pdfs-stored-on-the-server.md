Out of the box, PDFs are never stored on your web hosts filesystem permanently, and you won't find a directory containing PDFs for all your form entries. The reason for this is to safeguard your data and reduce the security risks associated with storing potentially sensitive information in a public folder on your host.

[Refer to the security documentation for more information about how Gravity PDF handles PDFs and the underlying filesystem](../users/pdf-security.md#pdfs-and-the-file-system).

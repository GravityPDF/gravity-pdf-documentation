Gravity Forms allows you to [export Form Entries to a CSV file](https://docs.gravityforms.com/exporting-form-entries/). If PDF(s) have been configured on the form and are active, you will have the option to include the PDF URL as a column in your export under the _Select Fields_ setting.

Towards the bottom of the available options for the _Select Fields_ setting will be the available PDFs, recognised by the prefix "PDF:".

## Security

There are a number of security protocols in place to prevent unauthorised access to PDF documents. Before using this feature it's recommended you [review the documentation detailing PDF security](pdf-security.md).

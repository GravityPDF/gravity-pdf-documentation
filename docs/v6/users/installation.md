## Plugin Requirements

Gravity PDF can be run on modern shared web hosting providers, and the easiest way to check if your host can run it is to [install the plugin](#installation). Gravity PDF has checks in place when you first activate it on your WordPress website, and it will let you know if there are any issues than need addressing.

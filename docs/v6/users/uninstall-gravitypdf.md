Like Gravity Forms, deactivating and deleting the Gravity PDF plugin from your website will NOT remove any settings, fonts, or custom templates. 

To completely uninstall the plugin, navigate to `Forms -> Settings -> Uninstall` in your admin area and select the "Uninstall" button on the Gravity PDF add-on. A prompt will appear, asking you to confirm, before settings, configuration, custom templates and fonts are deleted from your WordPress installation.

The plugin is automatically deactivated upon completion and can then be removed from your site.
